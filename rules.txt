7 types of rules

in order of precedence:
capital words are those used to match a pattern



1. hold, do nothing

@hold UNIT SELECTOR


2. renaming

SELECTOR is selector

bean.garbanzo is chickpea
soymilk is milk.soy

(does not apply if query already has a prefix (same or different))


3. addition and removal of properties

UNIT SELECTOR (+ property)
UNIT SELECTOR (- property)

(does not apply if property is already added or removed)

$ chickpea?dry 
$ chickpea?!cooked?!uncooked + cooked


4. prefixing

SELECTOR is selector

chickpea is legume
legume is vegetable


5. unit conversion

# UNIT SELECTOR is # unit selector


6. number conversion

@dec UNIT SELECTOR

@frac UNIT SELECTOR

(does not apply if already converted)


7. addition of ingredients

is item & item

rice is $ & sauce.soy

(this will add one unit of soy sauce to the
shopping list for every unit of rice)

1 bowl rice is $ $ $ & 1 tsp sauce.soy

you can omit the unnessessary &

rice is & sauce.soy
1 bowl rice is & 1 tsp sauce.soy


of course, you will likely want a more general formula

1 volume rice is & 0.01 $ sauce.soy



things you can select on:

UNIT
CATEGORY.CATEGORY.CATEGORY?PROPERTY?PROPERTY
UNIT CATEGORY.CATEGORY.CATEGORY?PROPERTY?PROPERTY

can use $ for wildcarding
can use ! to negate a property


The left side can have one of five forms

SELECTOR
UNIT SELECTOR
# UNIT SELECTOR
# SELECTOR
@command UNIT SELECTOR

we can distinguish by the number of words
the second and fourth forms can be distinguished
by if the first word is a valid number

operations
is rename or unit conversion, add a prefix
+ add a property
- remove a property


example

15 fl_oz chickpea + cooked is 1 can
bean.garbanzo is a chickpea
chickpea - cooked - uncooked - dry is + cooked
chickpea + dry is - dry + uncooked
1 volume chickpea + cooked is 1/3 $ $ + cooked - uncooked & 1 $ water - $

renaming, conversion, and prefixing all use "is" operator once

renaming: A is B (wildcard forbidden)
conversion: # A is # B (wildcard forbidden)
conversion: # A B is # C D
conversion: # A B is # C
prefixing: A (is) a B (wildcard forbidden)
search and replace: A (is) (a) synonym (of) B

+ $ keeps all properties, where they would otherwise
be discarded
- $ removes all properties, where they would otherwise be kept

example with units:

1 kg is 1000 g
1 mg is 1/1000 g
g is a mass

100 g carrot is 1 count carrot

declarations

A (assumed to be 1 meals_worth)
# A (assumed to be in count units)
# A B

@import path

priorities
0: hold
1: do nothing, likely meaning property edits, dec, frac
2: renaming, insertion
3: prefixing
4: hold units
5: single and double conversions
